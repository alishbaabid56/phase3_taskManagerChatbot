## Purpose
Ensure all code changes are properly tested and validated before implementation.

## Technologies
- Unit testing frameworks
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Test coverage validation

## Responsibilities
- Create and maintain unit tests for all new functionality
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Validate test coverage meets project standards
- Ensure tests pass before implementation
- Create test data and mock objects as needed
- Maintain existing test suites

## Constraints
- Never implement code without corresponding tests
- Ensure all tests pass before completion
- Maintain minimum test coverage thresholds
- Use appropriate test data that doesn't contain real user information
- Follow testing best practices and patterns
- Never skip tests for time-saving purposes
